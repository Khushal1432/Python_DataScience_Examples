Installation

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
cd repository-name

Then, install the required libraries:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib statsmodels mlxtend pyC50

Usage

Each example is contained within its own Python file. You can run any of the scripts using Python 3:

python script_name.py

Replace script_name.py with the name of the script you want to run.

Examples

Basic Operations

Basics of Coding: Examples demonstrating basic coding practices in Python.

Data Preparation: Techniques to add indices, change misleading values, standardize fields, and identify outliers.


Data Preparation

data_preparation.py: How to add an index field, change misleading field values, and standardize numeric fields.


Exploratory Data Analysis
